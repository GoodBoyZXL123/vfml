{"name":"JVFML","tagline":"Java Very Fast Machine Learning Toolkit","body":"### Very Fast Machine Learning Toolkit\r\nPedro Domingos and Geoff Hulten developed VFML in 2003 to experiment with applying machine learning techniques to situations where the scale of streaming data being learned from makes traditional techniques impractical. Their original work is described in:\r\n\r\n> Hulten, G. and Domingos, P. \"VFML -- A toolkit for mining high-speed time-changing data streams\" [http://www.cs.washington.edu/dm/vfml/](http://www.cs.washington.edu/dm/vfml/). 2003.\r\n\r\n### Very Fast Decision Tree\r\n\r\nJVFML is a Java implementation of Hulten and Domingos' Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) algorithm for building decision trees from streaming data using a statistical result known as the Hoeffding Bound. The Hoeffding Bound is used to decide when enough data instances have been processed to split a tree node and be confident that a traditional batch learner with all the data available would have made the same decision.\r\n\r\n### Weka Integration\r\n\r\nJVFML is designed to interface with [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/). Although using Weka eliminates a major advantage of VFDT (its ability to process streaming data sets one data instance at a time without ever loading the entire data set into memory), we feel a Weka implementation of VFDT is still a useful tool for experimenting with the algorithm.","google":"UA-39727776-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
