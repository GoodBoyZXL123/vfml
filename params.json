{"name":"JVFML","tagline":"Java Very Fast Machine Learning Toolkit","body":"# Very Fast Machine Learning Toolkit\r\nPedro Domingos and Geoff Hulten developed VFML in 2003 to experiment with applying machine learning techniques to situations where the scale of streaming data being learned from makes traditional techniques impractical. Their original work is described in:\r\n\r\n> Hulten, G. and Domingos, P. \"VFML -- A toolkit for mining high-speed time-changing data streams\" [http://www.cs.washington.edu/dm/vfml/](http://www.cs.washington.edu/dm/vfml/). 2003.\r\n\r\n## Very Fast Decision Tree\r\n\r\nJVFML is a Java implementation of Hulten and Domingos' Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) algorithm for building decision trees from streaming data using a statistical result known as the Hoeffding Bound. The Hoeffding Bound is used to decide when enough data instances have been processed to split a tree node and be confident that a traditional batch learner with all the data available would have made the same decision.\r\n\r\n## Weka Integration\r\n\r\nJVFML is designed to interface with [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/). Although using Weka eliminates a major advantage of VFDT (its ability to process streaming data sets one data instance at a time without ever loading the entire data set into memory), we feel a Weka implementation of VFDT is still a useful tool for experimenting with the algorithm.\r\n\r\n### Installation Instructions\r\n\r\n1. Download Weka from the project's [Downloads](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html) page and install it.\r\n2. Download the compiled JVFML jar: [vfml-weka-1.0.0.jar](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9qrDMuiaIaNdjRPUGNLUFBZRkU/edit).\r\n3. Copy _vfml-weka-1.0.0.jar_ into your Weka application home directory.\r\n4. Open a terminal (cmd.exe on Windows).\r\n4. Include _vfml-weka-1.0.0.jar_ on the Java classpath when launching Weka:<br\\>\r\n     `java -classpath weka.jar;vfml-weka-1.0.0.jar weka.gui.GUIChooser`\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Linux users should use : instead of ; when typing the previous command into the terminal.</p>\r\n<p>Note: To work with large data sets, the Java heap space allocated to Weka may need to be increased. To give Weka 2GB of memory (for example) add the following option to the command above `-Xmx2g`.</p>\r\n\r\n### Usage Instructions\r\n\r\nOnce Weka has been launched with the JVFML jar on the Java classpath, it can be used like any other Weka classifier. There should be two new classifiers available under _weka/classifiers/trees_: VFDT and CVFDT (CVFDT is an extension which support adapting to concept drift). Note that both classifiers currently only support nominal attributes and do not support missing values.\r\n\r\nFollow these steps as a quick way to get started running VFML using the default Weka data sets:\r\n\r\n1. Open the Weka Explorer.\r\n2. Open the _breast-cancer.arff_ data file.\r\n3. Choose _Filter > weka/filters/unsupervised/attribute/ReplaceMissingValues_ then click _Apply_.\r\n4. Click on the _Classify_ tab.\r\n5. Choose _Classifier > weka/classifiers/trees/VFDT_.\r\n6. Click _Start_.\r\n\r\n### Compilation Instructions\r\n\r\nJVFDT uses the build tool [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). We suggest viewing and editing the code using the [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/).\r\n\r\n1. Download [Eclipse IDE For Java Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/junosr2) (the version appropriate for your platform).\r\n2. Download and extract the [JVFML source](https://github.com/ulmangt/vfml/archive/master.zip).\r\n3. Open Eclipse and select _File > Import..._<br/>\r\n![Import Maven Project](http://ulmangt.github.com/vfml/images/tutorial/Eclipse1.png)\r\n4. Click _Browse..._ and select _vfml-master/weka_ directory from the downloaded jar.<br/>\r\n![Browse to Code Directory](http://ulmangt.github.com/vfml/images/tutorial/Eclipse2.png)\r\n5. Select the class _Test3.java_ and hit _ctrl+F11_ to run the test code.\r\n![Run the Test Code](http://ulmangt.github.com/vfml/images/tutorial/Eclipse3.png)","google":"UA-39727776-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
