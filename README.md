Very Fast Machine Learning Toolkit

Based on original work by Hulten, G. and Domingos, P. "VFML -- A toolkit for mining high-speed time-changing data streams" http://www.cs.washington.edu/dm/vfml/. 2003.

This repository contains minor bug fixes and tweaks to the build process (specifically to allow the code to compile under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS)
