<h1>Running VFML's Tools and Learners</h1>

This section describes how you can use the over two dozen tools and
learning algorithms that come with VFML to help you solve your own
data mining problems.

<h2>Getting Data</h2>

To use them you will first need to get access to some data sets.  The
<a href="gettingstarted.htm">getting started</a> documentation
contains some information on how to download the data sets that come
with VFML.  We will now briefly talk about how to construct your own.
The native data format for VFML is the <a href
="../appendixes/c45.htm">C4.5 Format</a> which was introduced by Ross
Quinlan with his C4.5 decision tree induction algorithm.  You can see
the <a href ="../appendixes/c45.htm">VFML appendex</a> for a detailed
description of the format, but we will also describe it here briefly.
Each data set in C4.5 format consists of several files, a
&gtstem&lt.names file that describes the data schema, a
&gtstem&lt.data file that contains training data, an optional
&gtstem&lt.test file that contains testing data, and an optional
&gtstem&lt.prune file that contains prune data.
